### After Gaining High-Level Knowledge (Dive Deeper)
- **CS188 Introduction to AI**  
  https://berkeleyai.github.io/cs188-website/  
  This includes graded assignments, homeworks, and projects. It requires familiarity with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), but you can still manage if you put effort into it.

- **MIT 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning**  
  https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/  
  This course involves deeper mathematics and the implementation of ML algorithms from scratch.

- **Andrew NG ML Specialization Course**  
  https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction  
  Andrew Ng explains most of the concepts with a lot of patience. It’s an awesome course for those looking to get a deeper understanding.

### Diving Deeper
Once you understand the fundamentals of ML—what it is, how it works, when to use it, and why—you will likely be curious to explore further. You can go with any of the following advanced courses based on your interests.

- **MIT Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science**  
  https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/  
  This is a 5-course program spread over 12-16 months. You can start with ML or Probability, then move on to Statistics (which is a bit more difficult, but manageable with effort). There are also courses on Time Series and Data Analysis.

- **DeepLearning.AI Specializations**  
  There are multiple specializations from Deeplearning.AI. Start with the Deep Learning specialization, then explore others based on your interests, such as:
  - NLP (Natural Language Processing)
  - Computer Vision
  - Generative AI
  - And more

## Jobs in AI and ML

If you're looking for jobs related to AI or ML, especially in research and solving real-world problems, a PhD degree is often required. Companies typically do not hire at the BTech level for research positions—this is a hard truth that needs to be accepted. However, for engineering roles like AI developer, ML engineer, or data scientist, you may find opportunities in startups or even in large companies. The key is to keep applying and networking.

### Path to Research Roles
The better path is to build a research background and pursue a PhD. You can either do a master's and then apply for a PhD, or directly apply for a PhD program. After completing a PhD, you will have multiple opportunities in large companies like Microsoft Research, Google DeepMind, and others, where you will solve real-world problems.
