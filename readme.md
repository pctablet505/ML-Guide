# AI Learning Guide

## Courses

### High Level Introduction

* CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
    * [https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/) [cite: 1]
* Google ML Crash Course
    * [https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) [cite: 1]

### After having high level knowledge you can go for little deeper

* CS188 Introduction to AI
    * [https://berkeleyai.github.io/cs188-website/](https://berkeleyai.github.io/cs188-website/) [cite: 1]
    * This includes graded assignments, homeworks and projects, requires familiarity to DSA but you can go on. [cite: 1]
* MIT 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning
    * [https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course) [cite: 2]
    * It has a little deeper mathematics, implementation of ML algorithms from scratch. [cite: 2]
* Andrew NG ML specialization Course
    * [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) [cite: 3]
    * He has explained most of the concepts with lot of patience, and it is an awesome course. [cite: 3]

### Diving deeper

* Once you understand what ML is, how ML works, how, when, and why to use it. You will be curious to learn more about it. You can go with any of the below ones that you find relevant to your interests. [cite: 4, 5]
    * MIT Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science
        * [https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/](https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/) [cite: 6]
        * It's a 5 course program spread over 12-16 months, and you can start with ML or Probability course, then go for statistics that is a little difficult but you can manage if you put effort into it. [cite: 6]
        * Then there are other courses like time series, data analysis. You can take if you wish. [cite: 7]
    * There are multiple specializations from Deeplearning.ai and you can take deep learning specialization, first then go for others depending on your interests, such as NLP, Computer Vision, Generative AI or others. [cite: 8]
    * Other ones that I found interesting
        * CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision
            * Lecture videos
                * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8IjYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8IjYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) [cite: 9]
            * Course website
                * [https://cs231n.stanford.edu/](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/) [cite: 9]
        * Deep Reinforcement Learning CS285, UC Berkeley
            * [https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) [cite: 9]

## Jobs

* If you are looking for jobs related to AI, or ML as research, and solving actual problems, it will require a PhD degree. [cite: 10]
* Companies don't hire for BTech level, it is hard truth, but you need to accept it. [cite: 11]
* For engineering roles like AI developer, ML engineer or data scientist, you may find some opportunities in startups, or even in big companies. [cite: 12]
* Only way is to keep applying and keep connecting with people. [cite: 13]
* If you get a chance in your current job, or some other teams is working on AI, you may connect with them and share your interests. [cite: 14]
* There might be luck and you could get to work on it. [cite: 15]
* Better way is to get some research background, and go for a PhD, either do a masters and then do a PhD or directly apply for phd. [cite: 16]
* After PhD, you will get multiple opportunities in big companies like Microsoft research, Google DeepMind and others where you will solve actual problems. [cite: 17]
